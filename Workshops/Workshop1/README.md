The workshop had the objective to  create a software that allow an user
to purchase arcade machines, with some customization options

The software was based on these user stories:
	1. As a customer I want to choose material of the arcade machine, 
	so that my arcade machine can be more customizable.
	2. As a customer I want to choose the color of the buttons of the arcade machine, 
	so that my machine can be more customizable.
	3. As a customer I want to see the list of available games of the arcade machine. 
	So that I know what games Iâ€™m going to buy with my arcade machine.
	4. As a customer I want to add new games to the list of games in the arcade machines, 
	so that I can have more games of my taste.
	5. As an Admin I want to add the customer information for the delivery, 
	so that I know where to deliver the machine and the information of the one buying it.
	6. As an Admin I want to have a log with the data of the clients, 
	so that the business can keep a follow-up of who are the customers.
